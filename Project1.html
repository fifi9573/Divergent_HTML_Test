    <center><p>In a futuristic Chicago, society is divided into 5 factions. 
        Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the 
        intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. When 
        all teenagers reach the age of 16, they must choose to either
        stay in their faction of birth, or transfer into another faction. 
        Beatrice Prior must make the decision to stay with her family in a 
        faction she feels she isn't right for, or to transfer into another
        faction, and leave her family behind. What follows is a highly 
        competitive initiation, where the newly renamed Tris must make some 
        tough decisions, but she must also keep a secret that she was warned 
        could mean death, while she juggles friends, initiation, and a newfound 
        love interest. But there is a secret lying beneath everything that 
        threatens to tear the city apart.
